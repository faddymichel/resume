\begin{abstract}

I studied Computer Science for five years (2005-2010).
Since then, I have been working as a software engineer in two big cities, Cairo and New York City.
During this period, I gained very good experience in Software Houses, News & Media, E-Commerce utilizing solid technology stacks for producing high-traffic consumer-facing web applications.
In each job, the challenge starts with self-learning and ends with mastering the systems and platforms that handles the majority of the work.
These systems include Adobe CQ5/AEM, Demandware, Netsuite, AWS, GCP, Jenkins, Apache Maven, Java Collections Framework,
Java NIO, Apache Lucene Core, etc.
My experience also goes beyond the back-end side to the front-end side working
with various technology stacks that are based on the three major web languages, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I have a very good understanding of the software production approaches being used in the market nowadays and the software tools,
JIRA and Git mainly, for managing the different steps of the process.
