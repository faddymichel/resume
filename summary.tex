As a Software Engineer with strong Computer Science skills,
I have the ability to play the role of a Joker in a team;
the person who can perform efficiently in different positions.
This is achieved by understanding the fundamentals of the various paradigms of programming languages---Imperative (e.g., C),
Object-Oriented (e.g., Java and JavaScript), Functional (e.g., Haskell and JavaScript), Logical (e.g., Prolog), Data-Driven (e.g., awk), etc.
This in-depth understanding of the power of languages to manipulate the machine lead to the ability
to work in any kind of project; leveraging any stack of technologies or architectures.
