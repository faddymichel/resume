                    Leader of Terzi
                </h3>

                Developed the idea of Terzi to be a platform for creating content management systems (CMS). The produced
                CMS is composed of 3 major parts:

                <h4>
                    Binders - The backend
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Binders are where the contents are organized and edited. Each binder contains sheets. Sheets contain
                    the content itself. Binders are basically a Linux-based system. To interact with the binders, the
                    standard streams (stdin, stdout and stderr) are used. This way there is no need for a database,
                    where each binder is directory and each sheet is a file in the filesystem. All the actions done with
                    the binders and their contained sheets are done through the shell commands; whether the built-in
                    commands or newly created commands.

                <h4>
                    Naked User Interface (NUI) - The frontend
                </h4>

                <p>
                    NUI is a minimal web-based user-interface. This is achieved by withdrawing the graphical side of the
                    user-interface. The goal of NUI is to provide a truely accessible interface.

            <section>

                <h4>
                    Bostagy - The link between Binders and NUI
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Bostagy connects Binders and NUI together through WebSocket protocol. NUI posts a command to Binders
                    in a message and waits for the output of the command (whether from stdout or stderr) in a response
                    message.
