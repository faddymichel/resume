To browse the World-Wide Web (w3), I could not find a textual browser that is as 
powerful as a graphical one.
Fortunately, there is a way to extend graphical browsers to provide a textual 
experience.
An HTML page is structured as a tree.
Apparently, UI designers and frontend developers are not paying too much 
attention to how the tree would mentally look like, they pay more attention to 
how the page visually look like instead.

Marmiton---meaning Chef Assistant in French and Egyptian---is a browser 
extension that provides me with commands to browse the tree of a web page.
These commands are similar to the commands: \texttt{[cd, ls, pwd, cat, rm]}.
Additionally, commands for filling and submitting forms.
Above that, I can connect from the terminal to Marmiton through a websocket 
connected to stdin and stdout.
