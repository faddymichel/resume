Nashaz
}
Even Music Making and Sound Design got polluted and dominated by the graphical 
world leaving their mental, acoustic and tactile natures aside---no wonder how 
imitative music is presently.

Nashaz---meaning dissonance in Egyptian---is my fix to this intentional dilemma.
It provides the commands to define music instruments, the various scales for a 
designed instruments, and either write or play a score with one of the scales 
and mix them gradually.
This is being achieved using Csound, alsa and, of course, bash.
